					Meet Mia
				</h2>
				<p class="text-lg-left">
					One day there was a girl called Mia. She was a very happy girl, she loved going to school. Every<br>morning she stood up early to go school and she loved writing and colouring. So one day her mother<br>and father decided to buy her a colouring book, pens, pencils, erasers and lots of things. Her father<br>was a drug addict so he left the house and stayed with his friends. One day he took a drug that is<br>very dangerous to his health and he died. So Mia was very heart broken and then she stayed with<br>her mother. Her Mother was very sick that time and was just thinking about her future and how she<br>will grow up if she dies. But Mia was very happy to stay with her mother and her grandmother. One<br>day her mother went to the hospital to go check how her health is and go take some ARV pills and<br>the doctor told her your health is very low and I think you will lose your life.<br>So Mia&rsquo;s mother did not want to but Mia&rsquo;s mind was on her and school work then she always made<br>Mia happy as her life is on stake. She got more and got some red pimples out in her face and Mia<br>asked, “mom what is going on, are you sick?” But she said no, I am not, I just wash my face with the<br>wrong soap, oh that&rsquo;s okay.<br>Then two days passed and Mia&rsquo;s mother passed away and she could not stop crying because she lost<br>her mother and father and that is very sad for me. Her family heard about Mia&rsquo;s mother passing and<br>her aunt took her as her daughter and Mia was so happy because her aunt does everything for her<br>so she lived there and she was educated but then her aunt was just using her so she found out about<br>it and left the house she stayed from that day on the street with no family friend or a phone.<br>Mia started working at a bottle store where people pick up bottles and throwing it away. So Mia one<br>day picked up a bottle that has ring on it so she decided to find the person who owns the ring. She<br>went to the jewellery store and asked “Hello, was there a woman or men looking for a ring? Oh, I<br>thought you are going to sell the ring but yes there was a women looking for it so she left her<br>number here. You can take it as well as her address number. So Mia took it and went as she looked<br>up she saw a giant house with big flowers and she was shocked to see it so she was shaking when<br>she rang the doorbell. A woman came out and said who are you and what do you want? I have a ring<br>here with me a woman gave me your address so here I am.<br>So Mia decided to build herself a house with boxes and she did. She did not have food to eat so she<br>started working at a carwash near her box house and she fell.<br>
